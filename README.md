# Linux Labs & Automation

This repository documents a series of hands-on Linux projects and educational web pages I created using real systems, including a Raspberry Pi 5. The goal is to demonstrate foundational Linux concepts, explore the command-line environment, and automate practical tasks using Bash scripting and cron jobs.

Each section below links to a live webpage that walks through concepts, tools, commands, and screenshots from my personal labs and experiences.
